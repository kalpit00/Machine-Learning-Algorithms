# Model Evaluation

## Overview

Focus on implementing various model evaluation techniques and metrics, with emphasis on cross-validation and performance metrics calculation.

## Files

- `cross_validation.py`: K-fold cross-validation implementation
- `evaluation.py`: Implementation of various evaluation metrics
- `logistic_regression.py`: Enhanced logistic regression with evaluation
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for evaluation

## Implementation Details

### Cross Validation

- K-fold splitting implementation
- Stratified sampling
- Performance averaging

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC Curve plotting

### Enhanced Logistic Regression

- Model validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas (for data loading)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
